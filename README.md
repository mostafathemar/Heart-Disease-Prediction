# Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms

# Description
This project is aimed at building a machine learning model that can predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical and demographic features. The model is built using Python and several libraries, including Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Seaborn,Matplotlib and NumPy.

# Data
The data used for this project was obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and consists of various features such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels and some features. The dataset can be found in "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset"

# Steps

1 - Data pre-processing: The dataset was cleaned and pre-processed to handle missing data, outliers, and normalize the numerical data.

2 - Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or correlations.

3 - Feature selection: Features were selected based on their importance in predicting heart disease using statistical methods.

4 - Model training and evaluation: Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, DecisionTree, support vector machine SVM, Naive Bayes , K-Nearest Neighbors and Ensemble models . The best model was selected based on its performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, and recall.

# Using some  hyperparameter optimization framework in machine learning 
1 - Optuna is a powerful and efficient technique for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning, especially when the search space is large or complex.

2 - Hyperropt It is an open-source Python library that uses a combination of random search and a technique called Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) to optimize hyperparameters.
